## Introduction ‚ú®

I've put together a learning path that significantly helped me improve my automation skills, and I believe it can do the same for you! üöÄ

So, how does this work for you if you're just starting out, whether you're fresh out of university üéì, switching careers üîÑ, or have basic (or no) knowledge of the **tools** around **automation**? ü§ñ

In that case, I highly recommend starting with the **prerequisites** first. üõ†Ô∏è You‚Äôll need to get familiar with the tools you‚Äôll be using and the systems you‚Äôll be automating to lay a strong foundation before diving into Ansible.

On the other hand, if you're like me and come from a different IT background‚Äîwhether it's programming üíª, infrastructure administration üñß, cloud administration ‚òÅÔ∏è, or something else‚Äîyou can **skip the prerequisites** and jump straight into the core content. 

This path is designed to get you up to speed and enhance your automation skills, no matter where you're starting from! üåü


## Prerequirements

<button class="collapsible-btn" onclick="toggleContent()">Close Prerequirements</button>

<div class="collapsible-content">
This section is specifically for those who don‚Äôt have any background in Linux administration, Windows administration, cloud administration, or programming. 

If you‚Äôre new to these areas, it's important to first build a foundational understanding of the basic concepts and tools that you'll be automating with Ansible.

By getting familiar with these fundamentals, you'll be better equipped to dive into automation and take full advantage of what Ansible has to offer.

To get started, you'll need to familiarize yourself with a few key concepts, CLI tools, scripting languages, and some basic knowledge of configuration, networking, and cloud management. 

These are essential because you'll be using Ansible to automate those tasks.

You don‚Äôt need to dive deep into all the videos‚Äîjust enough to get comfortable with the tools and concepts you'll be automating. 

This will give you a solid foundation as you move forward with Ansible and automation.

## Ansible Understanding the Basics:

### What is Ansible? ü§î

**Ansible** is a powerful tool that helps automate a wide range of **IT tasks**, such as **configuring networks**, **installing software**, **setting up servers** and **cloud infrastructure**, **managing configurations**, **sending and receiving messages**, and **more**.

It uses a simple **YAML format** text file to define tasks and connects to target machines using **SSH** ‚Äî **no additional software or agents are required**. Built on top of **Python**, **Ansible** leverages Python‚Äôs capabilities, meaning it can accomplish anything that Python can. What makes Ansible especially popular is that it doesn‚Äôt require you to be a Python programmer, and it‚Äôs incredibly easy to use.

This video will provide you with an introduction to Ansible, helping you understand its core concepts and getting you started on your learning path.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1id6ERvfozo&list=PLy7NrYWoggjxKDRWLqkd4Kbt84XEerHhB&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana" target="_blank">Ansible Tutorial - What is Ansible with TechWorldWithNana</a>


### infrastructure as code (IaC) üõ†Ô∏è

Familiarize yourself with the concepts of configuration management and **infrastructure as code (IaC)**.

Configuration management refers to the process of handling and maintaining consistent software configurations across systems, while Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

### Ansible‚Äôs architecture üèóÔ∏è

Next, dive into **Ansible‚Äôs architecture**. 

**Ansible** operates with a control node (the machine running Ansible commands), managed nodes (the machines being configured or automated), and inventory (the list of managed nodes). Understanding how these components work together is key to leveraging Ansible‚Äôs full potential.

After the installation section, let‚Äôs go over some key points to solidify your understanding.

### Installation üíæ

Install Ansible on your local machine or a control node. Ansible can be installed on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

Follow the official  for your operating system. 

You can follow the official <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html" target="_blank">Ansible installation Guide</a> for your operating system. Below are the installation commands for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and macOS

- RHEL:
<div class="code-snippet">
  <div class="highlight">
{% highlight command-line %}
sudo dnf install ansible
{% endhighlight %}
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)" title="Copy to Clipboard"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24"><path d="M 8 2 L 8 4 L 4 4 L 4 20 L 16 20 L 16 16 L 18 16 L 18 22 L 2 22 L 2 2 Z M 10 4 L 18 4 L 18 14 L 16 14 L 16 6 L 10 6 Z M 6 8 L 14 8 L 14 18 L 6 18 Z M 10 10 L 12 10 L 12 16 L 10 16 Z"></path></svg></button>
</div>
</div>

- MacOS
<div class="code-snippet">
  <div class="highlight">
{% highlight command-line %}
brew install ansible
{% endhighlight %}
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)" title="Copy to Clipboard"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24"><path d="M 8 2 L 8 4 L 4 4 L 4 20 L 16 20 L 16 16 L 18 16 L 18 22 L 2 22 L 2 2 Z M 10 4 L 18 4 L 18 14 L 16 14 L 16 6 L 10 6 Z M 6 8 L 14 8 L 14 18 L 6 18 Z M 10 10 L 12 10 L 12 16 L 10 16 Z"></path></svg></button>
</div>

### Ansible Key Concepts üóùÔ∏è

Before you start coding with Ansible, make sure to review these key concepts.

#### Where does Ansible run? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª

Ansible runs on the control host and uses SSH to communicate with target hosts, performing tasks and applying configurations.

#### Ansible Control Host üñ•Ô∏èüéÆ

The Ansible control host is the machine where Ansible is installed, and from which you run Ansible commands and playbooks.

#### Ansible Target Hosts üéØüíª

Target **hosts**, or **managed nodes**, are the machines that Ansible manages and configures.

#### Ansible Playbook ‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìö

An **Ansible playbook** is a YAML file that outlines the tasks Ansible will execute on managed systems in a specific order. It defines steps to configure servers, deploy applications, or install software on cloud platforms.

Here a **hello world ansible playbook** example:

<div class="code-snippet">
  <div class="highlight">
{% highlight command-line %}
---
- name: Hello World Playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Print Hello World
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Hello, World!"
{% endhighlight %}
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)" title="Copy to Clipboard"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24"><path d="M 8 2 L 8 4 L 4 4 L 4 20 L 16 20 L 16 16 L 18 16 L 18 22 L 2 22 L 2 2 Z M 10 4 L 18 4 L 18 14 L 16 14 L 16 6 L 10 6 Z M 6 8 L 14 8 L 14 18 L 6 18 Z M 10 10 L 12 10 L 12 16 L 10 16 Z"></path></svg></button>
</div>
</div>

#### Run your first Ansible Playbook üèÉ

To execute the playbook and simplify the process:

1. **Copy and Save**: Copy the YAML content into a file, e.g., `hello_world.yml`.

2. **Run with Inventory**:
   - If `hosts: all` is defined, you need an inventory file. Run:  
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook -i <inventory> hello_world.yml
     ```

3. **Simplify with `localhost`**:
   - Change `hosts: all` to `hosts: localhost` in the playbook.
   - This removes the need for an inventory file. Run:  
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook hello_world.yml
     ``` 

This works because `localhost` tells Ansible to execute directly on the control node without requiring an external inventory.

#### Ansible Inventory üìãüîß

In Ansible, the **inventory** defines the hosts where tasks will be executed.

You can create a simple inventory file with one or more hosts and groups.

Open your preferred text editor (I use VSCode) and create a file like this:

<div class="code-snippet">
  <div class="highlight">
{% highlight command-line %}
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[webservers:vars]
ansible_user=webadmin
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

[databases]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[databases:vars]
ansible_user=dbadmin
{% endhighlight %}
<button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode(this)" title="Copy to Clipboard"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24"><path d="M 8 2 L 8 4 L 4 4 L 4 20 L 16 20 L 16 16 L 18 16 L 18 22 L 2 22 L 2 2 Z M 10 4 L 18 4 L 18 14 L 16 14 L 16 6 L 10 6 Z M 6 8 L 14 8 L 14 18 L 6 18 Z M 10 10 L 12 10 L 12 16 L 10 16 Z"></path></svg></button>
</div>
</div>
